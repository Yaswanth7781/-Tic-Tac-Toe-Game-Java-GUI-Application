1) First create a javaproject folder and write source code in txt file and save it as TicTacToeGUI.java
Step 1: Compile Your Java File
  If your file is TicTacToeGUI.java, open terminal/cmd in that folder and run:
  javac TicTacToeGUI.java
  This generates a TicTacToeGUI.class file.
Step 2: Create a Manifest File
  Create a file named manifest.txt with the following content:
  Main-Class: TicTacToeGUI
  Make sure you press Enter after the last line, or it may break.
Step 3: Package into a JAR
  In the same folder, run:
  jar cfm TicTacToeGame.jar manifest.txt TicTacToeGUI.class
  This creates TicTacToeGame.jar — your executable app!
  if you encountered by this error 'jar' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file.
  then do this  Add to PATH:
    Search “Environment Variables” in Start Menu → Open
    Under System Variables, find Path, click Edit
    Click New → Paste the JDK bin path:
    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin
    Click OK on all windows
step 4: Create the .jar with your fixed manifest
    jar cfm TicTacToeGame.jar manifest.txt TicTacToeGUI.class
  If you’re using resources like icon.png, add it too:
    jar cfm TicTacToeGame.jar manifest.txt *.class icon.png
  Now run:
    java -jar TicTacToeGame.jar
